# SOLID Principles Summary

## Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
A class should have one, and only one, reason to change. This principle states that a class should only have one job or responsibility.

## Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means that the behavior of a module can be extended without modifying its source code.

## Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program. This ensures that a subclass can stand in for its superclass.

## Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. This principle suggests that many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.

## Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Additionally, abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.
